# Wilm0riens_MTG_Turn_Structure_Sheet

The idea of this turn structure sheet is to summarize the Magic: the Gathering Turn Structure in a table with different levels of complexity.

This project is inspired by [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/11w6wv/magic_the_gathering_turn_structure_cheat_sheet_pdf/). The main difference is that its directly taking the [original rule text from wizards.com](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) an puts it into the table format.
